                        ASVA by Kevvali is created with one purpose: <b> Pure Water, Better India.</b>We make alkaline hydration simple and reliable for Indian homes and businesses through <b>packaged alkaline water, refill jar subscriptions, and portable alkaline ionizer machines</b> under one accountable brand.

                        Most water solutions are fragmented, different vendors for bottles, jars, dispensers and devices. ASVA integrates everything with consistent quality controls, responsible packaging, and customer support designed for long-term trust.
